# Weather-Application


## Description

In this project, I created a dynamic weather forecast application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to search for a city and view the current weather conditions as well as a 5-day forecast. The user interface displays weather data in organized cards, with different styles based on the weather conditions, utilizing API data and responsive design techniques.

## Usage
The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
Time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future.
Click on a time block to enter an event.
Click the save button next to the time block to save the event.
Events are saved in local storage and will persist even after refreshing the page.
